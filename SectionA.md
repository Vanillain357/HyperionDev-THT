## Positive aspects of the review

The logic you applied in this task is correct and the use of a dictionary is impressive! With slight tweaking your code performed the required task.

## Aspects of the submission that could be improved

Unfortunately, there were a few mistakes in your code that lead to errors. You had some indentation issues and in line 5 you neglect to pass an argument. The code is also slightly inefficient as the declaration of a class does not really add anything to the task, simply defining a function would have worked. Please use more descriptive variable names and add some relevant comments to your work. Also note that snake case is the preferred style in Python.

## Overall feedback

You displayed sound logic and with some minor revision this is an impressive solution! Please have a look at this [style guideline](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and resubmit your task. I can't wait to see the final result!
