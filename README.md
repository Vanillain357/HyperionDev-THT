Hello, and thank you again for taking the time to review my application even though I have not yet finished my bootcamp. I really appreciate it!

## Section A
The instructions were to do sections A and C in different languages, I'm unfortunately not very comfortable with Java yet.
I've only completed one Java task and am still waiting for feedback.
As such, I've done both of these sections using Python. I hope this is okay? If not, I will try doing the section A Java task

## Section B
While maybe not technically very impressive, I was very proud of these to Python tasks. When I read the instructions for amazon.py I knew the obvious way was to use for loops.
Since the name of the function was the first word of each line of the input file however, I really wanted to use that to call a function!
I tried a few different ways and just couldn't crack it. I asked on discord, but no one could help make a string callable.
Eventually it occurred to me to use a dictionary and it finally worked!
Later in calculator.py I wanted to do the same thing, I used lambda rather than defining the different functions as it's much shorter and something I wanted to practice.

## Section C
I read the instructions for the task, and then only attempted it some time later at home, so I started writing the program without going through the instructions again.
It was quite modular with different functions to handle initial error checking, checking 10-digit codes, checking 13-digit codes and converting codes.
I also was asking for user input and printed out errors when the user made mistakes, but when I read through the instructions again I realised that's not really what's asked.
So I combined it all into one function that takes a string as an input and outputs the example output. I hope this is sufficient?
